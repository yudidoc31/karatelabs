overview
This is a self-contained project that is great for training or demo-ing all capabilities of Karate. It includes an app that has a working front-end UI and back-end API. Examples of API tests, API performance tests, API mocks and Web-Browser automation are included.

An 8 minute video ideal for beginners can be found here. Karate Kick Start - The TODO Sample and Demo Project. No programming or automation experience is required.

A longer video (20 minutes) which is a good introduction to Karate uses demos in this project and can be an additional reference: API Testing with Karate.
